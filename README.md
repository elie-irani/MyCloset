# MyCloset

Final grading project for Mobile Computing.


Fashion lover or not, i am pretty sure you have clothes burried in the back with the tags still on.
We forget about them and we don't even notice them.

How can i solve it?
  It's simple.
  
Houses are moving towards smart systems. We should have a tablet or a standing "mirror" that runs MyCloset. This app is a closet management software where you add and
remove clothes.

Implemented features:
  - Import pics of item from gallery
  - View all clothing 
  - Sort between Top or Bottom wear
  - Find Fit: Scroll through Top pieces and Bottom pieces and have them on top of each other to check color compatibility
  
To be implemented:
  - Import from camera directly
  - Crop background from import pics
  - Add more sections (Like eye wear, head wear, shoes ...)
  - Smart suggestion algo. : Suggests opposite piece of clothing of the one pick initially
  - Frequency counter: Keeps track of worn pieces and increases the odds for the least worn items in the feature above
  - Similar to Amazon Go, find a way to keep track of what's picked or added to the closet
